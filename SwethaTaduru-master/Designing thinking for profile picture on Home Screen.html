  <p class="p_txt">Designing thinking for profile picture on Home Screen</p>
  <span class="underline_1"></span>

  <p class="p1"> In the <a href="https://swethaa1006.github.io/SwethaTaduru/Game%20Design.html">previous blog</a>, I briefly explained how I was going to approach the redesign of the home screen for a gaming app.<br><br>

    Now, I will be looking more closely at each element that is present on the screen.<br><br>

    Let me start with the profile image. Before I started designing I had a set of questions.<br><br>

    1. What role does the profile image play in the home screen? After all, it is your photo.<br>
    2. Does it impact looking at your photo every time you open the Home screen? <br>
    3. Home large should the image be? <br>
    4. Does having a personalized image frame add anything, Just like the physical frame we use in our everyday life, and place it where it is visible?<br>
    5. Where should the profile image be placed on the screen?<br><br>

    With all these questions in mind, I started researching and came up with a set of inspirations by looking at different gaming apps. I looked closely at how they have placed the profile images and position on the screen.<br><br>

     I observed that most of the games initially had a placeholder but later could be customized to our choice. Some games had a provision to display your original photo when you login using your Facebook. <br><br>
As for the shape, they adopted the theme of the game style guide. Some had circular, while others had rounded corners and a few had square.<br><br>
With the profile image, some had displayed the player name or ID while others had used the space to show levels. I went with the same approach of showing the level.<br><br>
 The main question of why the profile is shown on the home screen which I had to answer in the first place, is one to show the feeling of belonging and the motivation to play more and move ahead to reach higher goals!<br><br>

 This was the final image I came up with. <br><br>
