  <h2 class="d">Desiger as Producer</h2>
  <p class="p_txt">What is a designer as a producer for me?</p>
  <span class="underline_1"></span>

  <p class="p1"> Let me take you through my journey of how I came across p5.js. During my Masters at UIC School of Design at Chicago I took up p5.js classes as my elective. I was so curious that I started exploring and started what processing(1) and
    p5.js was
    actually made for.<br><br>I watched a lot of Daniel Shiffman's videos and also with the help of p5.js website, I started experimenting a lot using this technology.

    <br><br><br><br><br>I made many experiments each one just trying to break or push the boundaries of the technology itself and it just being an experimental gesture. I was still questioning what did all this mean to me? Am I taking the role of an
    author? Or a
    producer? Is the medium important to me to produce these things?<br><br>

    I took forward and pursued all these questions into my thesis. The first question I wanted to answer was how would the role of producer push boundaries by a designer?<br><br>

    I did so by making a chrome extension that changes any, or most of the websites's entire placement of the text in form of design patters and the typography to a different format as a whole while trying to print. I wanted this to be availabe to others, so I made it open source and uploaded in github. You can download <a href="https://github.com/swethaa1006/Thesis-Chrome-extension">it
      here.</a>
    Some of the examples can be viewed in the book.<br><br><br><br><br>

    <br><br><br><br><br><br>

    I didn't stop there. I wanted to explore how it can be brought into a physical format? So I made a book out of it. It had three main essays that shaped my thesis. So I made websites of these content and hacked them using my chrome extension and
    made
    a book out of it. You can view the book in UIC School of Design. The video is below.

    <br><br><br><br>
    Lastly I demonstrated the entire thing in my thesis presentation as enlarged rolls of hacked content on walls, portraying all of the essays I had referred to.<br><br>

    While I look back at all the work I started to question was this an art piece? As I thought about it I realised I do need the audience to participate in the work and pursue the work as they view it while using the chrome extension in their own
    way by dowloading and sharing it. I also want to get out of the tools that are already existing and use computer is produce tools. After all computer is a tool to produce tools. There is more I will be exploring and inquiring would there be only
    audience or is there a journey from audience to users?
