      <!-- With a passion for creating intuitive and visually appealing user experiences, 
      I am confident that my skills align perfectly.
      
       <br>Throughout my career,
       I have consistently demonstrated a keen eye for 
       design and an unwavering commitment to crafting user-centric interfaces. 
       My experience in both UI and UX design, coupled with my proficiency in front-end 
       development technologies, uniquely positions me to 
       contribute positively to projects.
      
      <br>
      I thrive in collaborative environments and am skilled
       in using industry-standard design tools such as Adobe Creative Suite, Sketch, and Figma. Moreover, my understanding of responsive design principles and 
       accessibility guidelines ensures that my designs are not only visually appealing 
       but also functional across various devices and user needs. -->
       I find people so fascinating. I am relentlessly curious about humans and their motivations, which drive decisions and habits, ultimately resulting in actions. I strive to learn about audience needs, wants, and aspirations with the goal of creating digital experiences that are empowering, intuitive and useful so people may lead happier, more meaningful lives.
  <br>
      
       My background in visual design has lent many principles and skills that strengthen my proficiency in user experience research and design. In recent years, I have turned my focus and passion to the qualitative and quantitative user research and testing that informs experience design, resulting in the optimization of complex processes into efficient workflows. One of my favorite
       things about UX research and design is how the learning never ends, no matter the business.
