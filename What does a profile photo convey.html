  <p class="p1"> <em>What does a profile image convey? Is it a way to portray your self. What if we take the same profile image and make it unrecognizable? Will it still portray you?</em>
<br><br>

    I had many questions about what a profile photo can convey beyond how we use it in our everyday life. Some of them being.<br><br>

    1. In many applications, we find different filters to make you look better or add an environment around you. Why and What does that convey?<br>
    2. The next question is should only one image be sown as a profile image? What happens when you use multiple experimented images put together? <br>
    3. When and what is the impact when you see your photo on a digital medium or a website wit interaction? What does it feel when you save the image and look at the static image? And lastly what it feels when you look at the same image in physical formate holding in your hands. <br>
    4. My last question is as an audience how each media impacts? <br><br>

    To answer these questions I made a website where I uploaded some of my photos and experimented with them. I was mixing different filters and making multi-image photos.
